# RandoPhoto
Photo gallery to experiment with React consisting of the following:

- App component holds app state (not enough to warrant Flux storage)
- Main photo view
	- photos cross-fade on transition?
- Thumbnail list
	- button nav (direction is just css rotated)
	- thumbnail
	- list page (maybe note indicating randomness)
	- animations when scrolling pages
- Fullscreen view
	- clicking main photo activates fullscreen overlay w/ skrim (calc max height/width and set something like 90v[hw] accordingly)
	- clicking skrim closes fullscreen

## Photo API
Use picsum API to fetch list of pics
Get random number for page number so not always the same (to start, all pagination after/before should be correct)
thumbnails extract ids from "download_url"s
hover gives author credit
selected gives author & unsplash links
example link: http://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=17

## Initial ReadMe from `create-react-app`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
